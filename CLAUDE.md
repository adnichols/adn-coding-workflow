# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains documentation for a structured AI-assisted software development workflow using Claude Code. The core asset is `claude-desktop-coding-workflow.html` - an interactive HTML documentation system that outlines a comprehensive development methodology with specialized agents and structured commands.

This site is primarily used for a github pages site hosted at <https://adnichols.github.io/adn-coding-workflow/> . You should review that site after making changes to assure the change resulted in correct appearance and functionality

The workflow described on this site is not necessarily used to maintain this repository

## Architecture Overview

The workflow system is built around six main phases:

1. **Idea & Initial Specification** - Converting concepts into structured requirements
2. **Architecture Review & Planning** - Using specialized agents to create implementation plans
3. **Task List Generation** - Breaking down plans into executable steps
4. **Automated Execution** - Implementing with safety protocols and git management
5. **Quality Review & Integration** - Multi-layered AI and human review
6. **Final Integration** - Human verification and merge

## File Structure

- `claude-desktop-coding-workflow.html` - Complete interactive workflow documentation
- `/tasks/` - Directory for generated PRDs, task lists, and simplification plans (created as needed)

## Development Notes

This is a documentation repository focused on workflow methodology rather than active code development. The HTML file is self-contained and includes all necessary CSS and JavaScript for the interactive interface.

When working with this repository:

- The HTML file contains embedded workflow commands and agent configurations
- No build, test, or lint commands are applicable as this is pure documentation
- Any modifications should preserve the interactive functionality and complete workflow documentation
